# etherlab
A place for my smart contract experiments on the Ethereum VM. Expect minimal organization and lots of broken code.

Until such time as Solidity supports importing other contracts, I'm using [Preprocessor.js](https://www.npmjs.com/package/preprocessor) to merge the contracts into a single file suitable for passing to solc or AlethZero.
